This is the website that I used to make our Binder (launch icon above) - these config files are used to give access to Python libraries as well as start and run the Python environment remotely.
Basically, it's telling JupyterLabs what sort of configuration you want for your remote Lab (Binder is the website that makes using JupyterLabs easier for newbies like us)
